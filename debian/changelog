signald (0.16.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Full release notes at https://gitlab.com/signald/signald/-/releases/0.16.0
  * log4j has been updated to 2.17.1 (safe from CVE-2021-44228)
  * reconnect/backoff logic improvements: https://gitlab.com/signald/signald/-/merge_requests/86 - thanks @sumner!
  * v2 group storage has been moved to the database
  * a watchdog now runs while decrypting messages. If the decryption takes too long, we assume it's hanging and exit signald non-gracefully.
    * The default timeout is 10 seconds, but this can be changed via command line flag `--decrypt-timeout`.
  * WebSocketConnectionState messages will be emitted to allow subscribed clients to closely monitor the state of the underlying websocket https://gitlab.com/signald/signald/-/merge_requests/87 - thanks @sumner!
    * ListenerState messages are still broadcast.
  * Options for responding to challenges while sending messages have been added
    * ProofRequiredError will come through in a new field of JsonSendMessageResult, including token and response options.
    * submit_challenge request type added to submit challenges for proofs
  * send, react and other request types that send messages to groups now have a "members" field which can be used to specify the subset of members to send to
  * linking URIs have been updated to use the sgnl://linkdevice URI format
  * requests will be processed even if the requesting socket has shut down https://gitlab.com/signald/signald/-/merge_requests/90 and https://gitlab.com/signald/signald/-/merge_requests/92 - thanks @sehaas
  * new request type: is_identifier_registered to explicitly check the registration status of a Signal identifier https://gitlab.com/signald/signald/-/merge_requests/97 - thanks @inwaves!
