signald (0.17.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Full release notes at https://gitlab.com/signald/signald/-/releases/0.17.0
  * A huge shout out to @sumner for fixing the memory leak (https://gitlab.com/signald/signald/-/merge_requests/114)
  * Messages sent to groups will now try to use the sender keys feature, which should improve group send speed especially
     in larger groups
  * New request type wait_for_scan is available to allow faster user feedback when linking
  * Some new options for dealing with remote key rotation have been introduced:
    * --trust-new-keys (or environment variable SIGNALD_TRUST_NEW_KEYS=true) will cause new keys to be marked as
        TRUSTED_UNVERIFIED instead of UNTRUSTED, which is more in line with most user expectations.
    * --trust-all-keys-on-start (or environment variable SIGNALD_TRUST_ALL_KEYS=true) will update the trust store to
        mark all UNTRUSTED keys as TRUSTED_UNVERIFIED, which should help fix issues caused by lack of --trust-new-keys
        option earlier.
    * Eventually --trust-new-keys may become the default, if you have feelings on this topic file an issue, drop by the
        chat room or send me an email
  * Several improvements around session locking have been fixed. This may result in slightly slower send/receive times,
      but significantly better deliverability
  * Message resend requests are now automatically sent on message decryption failures (in line with first party clients)
  * Several new metrics are available, including timing around all SQL queries
  * Read support for the storage service has been implemented. This should fix most of the contact and group syncing
      issues people have been experiencing.
  * Sentry support has been added to report exceptions. This is disabled by default and there isn't really a way to turn
      it on without signing up for [Sentry](https://sentry.io) or hosting your own server. Set environment variable
      SENTRY_DSN to use.
    * after enabling Sentry support, many exceptions that were previously uncaught have been caught and handled better
    * some of these resulted in new error types from in the protocol

  * WebSocketConnectionState messages will be emitted to allow subscribed clients to closely monitor the state of the underlying websocket https://gitlab.com/signald/signald/-/merge_requests/87 - thanks @sumner!
    * ListenerState messages are still broadcast.
  * Options for responding to challenges while sending messages have been added
    * ProofRequiredError will come through in a new field of JsonSendMessageResult, including token and response options.
    * submit_challenge request type added to submit challenges for proofs
  * send, react and other request types that send messages to groups now have a "members" field which can be used to specify the subset of members to send to
  * linking URIs have been updated to use the sgnl://linkdevice URI format
  * requests will be processed even if the requesting socket has shut down https://gitlab.com/signald/signald/-/merge_requests/90 and https://gitlab.com/signald/signald/-/merge_requests/92 - thanks @sehaas
  * new request type: is_identifier_registered to explicitly check the registration status of a Signal identifier https://gitlab.com/signald/signald/-/merge_requests/97 - thanks @inwaves!
