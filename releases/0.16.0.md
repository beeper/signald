# signald 0.16.0

[see all code changes here](https://gitlab.com/signald/signald/-/compare/0.15.0...0.16.0)

It's been a few months since the last release and there have been enough fixes and improvements that we need to do a
release.

# Reminder: Docker Hub Image is signald/signald

The previous image still gets pulled a lot, so I will try update it for release but it no longer gets automatic updates
and the `:latest` tag will be deleted soon. Please switch to [one of the supported image locations](https://signald.org/articles/install/docker/).

# Changes

For full change set see diff linked above. Here are the main features and major bug fixes:

* log4j has been updated to 2.17.1 (safe from CVE-2021-44228).
* reconnect/backoff logic improvements ([!86](https://gitlab.com/signald/signald/-/merge_requests/86)) - thanks @sumner!
* v2 group storage has been moved to the database
* a watchdog runs while decrypting messages. If the decryption takes too long, we assume it's hanging and exit signald non-gracefully.
  * The default timeout is 10 seconds, but this can be changed via command line flag `--decrypt-timeout`.
* [`WebSocketConnectionState`](https://signald.org/protocol/structures/v1/WebSocketConnectionState/) messages will be
emitted to allow subscribed clients to closely monitor the state of the underlying websocket
([!87](https://gitlab.com/signald/signald/-/merge_requests/87)) - thanks @sumner! 
  * [`ListenerState`](https://signald.org/protocol/structures/v1/ListenerState/) messages are still broadcast.
* Options for responding to challenges while sending messages have been added
    * [`ProofRequiredError`](https://signald.org/protocol/structures/v1/ProofRequiredError/) will come through in a new
field of [`JsonSendMessageResult`](https://signald.org/protocol/structures/v1/JsonSendMessageResult/), including token and response options.
      * [`submit_challenge`](https://signald.org/protocol/actions/v1/submit_challenge/) request type added to submit challenges for proofs
* send, react and other request types that send messages to groups now have a "members" field which can be used to specify the subset of members to send to
* linking URIs have been updated to use the `sgnl://linkdevice` URI format.
* requests will be processed even if the requesting socket has shut down ([!90](https://gitlab.com/signald/signald/-/merge_requests/90)
and [!92](https://gitlab.com/signald/signald/-/merge_requests/92)) - thanks @sehaas
* new request type: [`is_identifier_registered`](https://signald.org/protocol/actions/v1/is_identifier_registered/) to
explicitly check the registration status of a Signal identifier ([!97](https://gitlab.com/signald/signald/-/merge_requests/97)) - thanks @inwaves!
* signaldctl has been added to the docker image ([!100](https://gitlab.com/signald/signald/-/merge_requests/100)) - thanks @lawrencegripper!
