# signald 0.16.1

[see all code changes here](https://gitlab.com/signald/signald/-/compare/0.16.0...0.16.1)

A patch release to get a nasty SQL bug fixed. More details in [#271](https://gitlab.com/signald/signald/-/issues/271).
When first started, signald will query the server for group details and update the local data store. This should mitigate
any effects the bug may have had on your local state.

Other changes:
* Shared contact info is now properly encoded as v1 protocol objects ([!106](https://gitlab.com/signald/signald/-/merge_requests/106) - thanks @tulir)
* Gradle was updated and Java 17 is now supported
