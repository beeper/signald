[see all code changes here](https://gitlab.com/signald/signald/-/compare/0.18.5...0.19.0)

* All critical data now stored in database
  * Avatars, group images, attachments, etc are still stored on the disk for now
  * None of these need to be kept around for signald to continue working
* New command line flag `--migrate-data` tells signald to preform all required data migrations and exist
* Other minor fixes
