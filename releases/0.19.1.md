# signald 0.19.1

[see all code changes here](https://gitlab.com/signald/signald/-/compare/0.19.0...0.19.1)

just a few small bugfixes:
* Some minor improvements to how postgres connection loss is handled
  * It's still not great, but it should mostly recover when the db recovers
* Made some fixes for handling nulls in profile table
  * most profile fields may not be null and default to an empty string now
